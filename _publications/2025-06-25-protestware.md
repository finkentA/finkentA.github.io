Abstract: Protests are public expressions of personal or collective discontent with the current state of affairs. Although
traditional protests involve in-person events, the ubiquity of computers and software opened up a new avenue
for activism: protestware. Recent events in the Russo-Ukrainian war have sparked a wave of protestware,
especially in the open-source community. While news and media heavily report individual protestware as
discovered, an in-depth understanding of how they impact the open-source software supply chain is largely
missing. In particular, we do not have a detailed understanding of their characteristics and impact on the
open-source community who rely on free contributions. To address this gap, we first collect 163 samples of
libraries that are either modified (protestware) or created (which we call protestware enablers) with a clear
intention to protest. In addition, we analyze the aftermath of the protestware, which has the potential to affect
the software supply chain in terms of community sentiment and usage. We report that: (1) protestware has
three notable characteristics, namely, i) the way protests are induced is diverse, ii) the altered functionality
can be discriminatory, and iii) the transparency (i.e. reporting the change for protest) is not always respected;
(2) disruptive protestware may cause a substantial adverse impact on downstream users; (3) developers of
protestware may not shift their beliefs even with push
