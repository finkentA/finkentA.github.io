In this talk, I reviewed the details in the paper for our study performed on Protestware. 
For our collected dataset, I discussed the characteristics seen in the protestware, as well as the impacts that were seen by some of the protestware.
The paper can be found [here](https://sazzadur.com/pdfs/ProtestwareFSE.pdf) and includes a Zenodo link to our dataset.
